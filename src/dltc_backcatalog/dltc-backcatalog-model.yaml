  abstract: |
    A-theorists and B-theorists debate whether the "Now" is
    metaphysically distinguished from other time slices. Analogously,
    one may ask whether the "I" is metaphysically distinguished from
    other perspectives. Few philosophers would answer the second
    question in the affirmative. An exception is Caspar Hare, who has
    devoted two papers and a book to arguing for such a positive
    answer. In this paper, I argue that those who answer the first
    question in the affirmative---A-theorists--- should also answer
    the second question in the affirmative. This is because key
    arguments in favor of the A-theory are more effective as arguments
    in favor of the resulting combined position, and key arguments
    against the A-theory are ineffective against the combined
    position.

    Haji argues that determinism threatens deontic morality, not via a
    threat to moral responsibility, but directly, because of the
    principle that "ought" implies "can". Haji's argument requires not
    only that we embrace an "ought" implies "can" principle, but also
    that we adopt the principle that "ought" implies "able not to". I
    argue that we have little reason to adopt the latter principle,
    and examine whether deontic morality might be destroyed on the
    basis of the more commonly embraced "ought" implies "can"
    principle alone. I argue that despite what look like initially
    compelling reasons why we might suppose that this weaker
    conclusion is similarly destructive to deontic morality, we
    actually have good reason to doubt that it has any practical
    relevance for moral deliberation at all.
